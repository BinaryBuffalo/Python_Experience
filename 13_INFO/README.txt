Recently I have been super busy with school & have been slacking off on my book reading
so I took a break for a month or so.

Well im back !!

Another issue I incountered with chapter 9 Was alot & I mean ALOT! of debugging problems, stuff just not working right & thats just because
windows can't make a proper File Explorer, My linux WSL made it super easy for me but for anyone using Windows GOOOOD LUCK!
